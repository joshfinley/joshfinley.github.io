    <p>Hi. This site mostly exists for my own reference notes and to practice my technical writing from time to time. Occassionally, I will show off notable software projects that I'm able to freely share. My particular interests revolve around Windows malware, assembly, and at one point in time, meteorology.</p>
    <p>The site design is influenced heavily by <a href="gwern.net">gwern.net</a> and, by extension, the "old" world of words-on-paper and plain hypertext. My posts leverage some dynamic content, but the site is still designed such that not much will change if that ever breaks.</p> 
    <p>The repo backing this site contains some utilities for archiving references and generating citations. The static site tool in use is <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> with some shortcode extensions for making things a bit fancier, including bibliographies, footnotes, figures, and quotes. </p>

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
