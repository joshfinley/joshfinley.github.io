# About This Blog

This blog serves as a repository for articles and short posts on my projects in cybersecurity. The content ranges from breakdowns of malware obfuscation techniques to custom implementations of security tools, analyses of CVEs, and low-level programming experiments. 

Some recurring themes you'll find here:

- Reverse engineering of malware and software
- Vulnerability research and exploit analysis
- Low-level systems programming in C, C++, and Assembly
- Cloud security tooling and AWS penetration testing
- Windows internals and security research

These posts represent my notes from the field, structured into (mostly) coherent technical narratives. While the code samples and techniques demonstrated here have legitimate educational and professional uses, I maintain a strong emphasis on responsible disclosure and ethical application of security research.

The blog theme is currently based on [The Monospace Web](https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/) project, with a few tweaks, built on Hugo. I firmly believe in the power of text and simple documents for sharing ideas.
