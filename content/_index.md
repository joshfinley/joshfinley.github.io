# About This Blog

This blog serves as a repository of technical deep-dives, security research, and programming projects I've worked on throughout my career. As someone who operates at the intersection of software development and security, I document my explorations in reverse engineering, vulnerability analysis, exploit development, and tool creation.

My content ranges from detailed breakdowns of malware obfuscation techniques to custom implementations of security tools, analyses of CVEs, and low-level programming experiments. I believe in understanding systems from first principles - whether that's tracing through assembly code, unpacking obfuscated malware, or building tools that interact with cloud APIs in novel ways.

Some recurring themes you'll find here:

- Reverse engineering of malware and software
- Vulnerability research and exploit analysis
- Low-level systems programming in C, C++, and Assembly
- Cloud security tooling and AWS penetration testing
- Cryptographic implementations and analyses
- Windows internals and security research

These posts represent my notes from the field, structured into coherent technical narratives. While the code samples and techniques demonstrated here have legitimate educational and professional uses, I maintain a strong emphasis on responsible disclosure and ethical application of security research.

Whether you're a security professional, systems programmer, or curious technologist, I hope you find these explorations both instructive and thought-provoking.
