Notes on Severe Weather Spotter Training on 3-24-2020

## Role of the spotter
1. Stay safe
2. Observe & Identify
   1. Weather type
   2. Location
3. Report
   1. Emergency managers
   2. NWS


- The farther a storm is from a radar, the higher the altitude of the scanning area
- Spotters fill the gap between the radar and the ground
- Remote measurement tools can help indicate a tornado may be forming, but spotters can only confirm it
- Boxes around radar telemetry are called polygons and are related to warning for storms
- Spotter reports give confirmation of warning and give information that may indicate that the warning should be extended or changed
- Helps across counties
- Helps tools calibration

What is a severe thunderstorm?
- hail 1" diameter or larger
- Wind 58 mph or more
- tornado

When is tornado season?
- A tornado can occur at any time of the year
- Tornado climatology
- Majority occur spring/early summer
- Oklahoma averages 56/yr
- We've had two as of today
- Last year was a record of 149, 105 in May
- majority of tornadoes were weak (below ef3)

Tornado Intensity
- Cannot be determined visually
- Size is not a reliable indiciator
- Determined by damage done
- EF0 65-85mph
- Damage Indicator is ranked on an index
  
Watches and Warnings
- Watch
  - Valid 4-6 hours typically
  - SVR WX possible
  - Can be large (100 mi+) areas
- Warning
  - SVR WX Likely
  - Valid 1 hr or less typically
  - Flash flooding can be 3 hours or less
  

Storm Spotting Strategies:
Being Safe and Informed
- Check NWS website
- Check spc.gov for Convective outlooks
- Read Hazardous Weather Outlook
  - 5AM noon weather radio
- Listen to Weather Radio
- Watch satellite/radar

NEW-SPC Probablitiy Day-2 Outlooks
- Tornado, hail, wind

Spotter Safety
- Dont spot alone
- Know where you are
- Know where the storm is
- Know hos it is moving
- Have an escape route
- Seperate spotters should focus on different objects. One set of eyes on one object.
- Know whether roads are paved or not

Lightning Hazards
- Lightning is the biggest hazard
- If you can hear thunder, lightning is close enough to strike you
- Lightning is extremely unpredictable
- Stay inside your vehicle
- External antennae can be lightning rods. Avoid contact with the microphone itself

Tornado hazards
- Downdraft winds
- Hail
- Debris
- Know an escape route
- Be extra cautious when visibility is low (natural and manmade)
- Debris is a huge threat (dumpster example from 2019 El Reno, not an intense tornado. Still flung a dumpster)
- You should not be able to see debris near you
- Tornadoes do not always move in a straight line. El Reno almost did complete U turn

After Dark
- Very dangerous
- Reference points for distance of objects are criticals
- Lightning BEHIND an object like a tornado is helpful. In front is extremely hazardous because it can destroy night vision
  
Vehicles
- If a tornado is approaching your vehicle, abandon the vehicle
- Flooding is #1 severe weather killer in US. Mainly at night
  
Hail
- Large hail can impact over 90mph

Other hazards - Humans
- Other spotters
- Media
- Researchers
- Traffic can hinder escapes

After the Storm
- Tree limbs
- power lines
- power poles


## Identifying Key Features
- Storm Mode
  - Primary mode in Central plains are squall lines and supercells
  - Both can occur at the same time
- Squall Line
  - Long, continuous line of thunderstorms
  - Front edge is usually  most severe
  - Strong straight lived winds, short lived tornadoes
  - Spotters see low clouds often with motion underneath
  - Very heavy rain, strong gusty winds
  - Tornadoes less likely, but can happen along the leading edge
  - Positioning and viewing
    - Find updraft area (ordinarily near fron of line)
    - Find the updraft and downdraft convergence - tornado most likely here
    - Supercells have severe weather more likely towards the back
- Supercell
  - Rotating updraft
  - Organized, Long lasting storm
  - Most significant severe weather
  - Classic supercell
    - Bands (striations) indicate a rotating updraft
    - Lightning strike may precede heavy rain or hail by several miles
  - LP supercells
    - Low precipitation production
      - Cant be easily seen on radar
      - Updarfts small in size
      - Very large hail threat from vault area
      - Tornadoes not a frequent threat
      - Tornadoes will be less intense than classic supercell
  - HP supercells
    - High precipitation
    - Extremely dangerous, especially for spotters
      - No ideal spots to see tornadoes forming
      - Prolific flash flood producers
      - Strong downbursts
      - Copious hail producers
- Updrafts and Downdrafts
  - Wind shear, causing the updraft to lean over, causing rain and hail to fall down front of the the updraft
  - Upraft area is location of largest hail and possibility of tornado
  - E.g. Rain free base with striations in the back, downpour in the front
  - Near the intersection between rain edge and updraft area is most likely area for tornado
  - Rain will highlight the rotating updraft on the radar
  - Farther away the storm is, the smaller the hook echo will look

### Anvil clouds
  - Formed as storm updraft expands
  - Can be used to indicate strength of updraft
  - pulse like (weak)? thin? thick? back sheared? VERY STRONG
### Mammatus
  - Not an indicator of severity
  - Formed by differential evaporation 
### Convective updraft
  - Primary mature updraft
  - Visually gaugable to see strength/health
  - Best view is behind the storm
  - If the updraft is protruding above the anvil indicate high strength
  - Fluffier, looser cloud are likely weaker
### Flanking Line
  - New towers that typically extend southwest of main rotating updraft
  - Towering cumulus leading to the main updraft
  - Watch for subsequent updrafts along the flanking line
### Updraft Vault
  - Small localized area between downdraft (where rain is falling) and updraft
  - If you can see the vault that means you are very close 
    - you should be very aware of your situation
    - Wind at your back
  - Area of possibly largest hail
### Rain Free base
  - Depicts where air is rising
  - Generally smooth, can exist for several hours
  - Focus on this region for tornadic potential
  - Watch for lowering wall cloud
  - Not to be confused with a wall cloud

- These are large scale features of storms

## Smaller Scale Storm Features
### Wall cloud
  - localized lowering of main updraft cloud base
  - Cyclonic rotation
  - Small compared to storm
  - Usual distinct slope towards FFD
  - Often injesting humid, rain cooled air
    - Lifting air cools, increases in relatively humidity
    - As it approaches 100% humidity, undergoes phase change and becomes cloud
    - In wall clouds, air is condesnsing into a cloud at a lower altitude,
    - typically attached to base of updraft.
  - several hundred yards to mile
  - Usual distinct slope to FFD
  - Distinct from shelf cloud, which slopes away from where its raining
  - Slopes toward rain area
- Dangerous wall clouds
  - Persistent rotation
  - Lowering over time
  - Wind is typicall at your back toward the wall cloud
  - If the wind at your back intensifies toward the wall coud signals intensifying wall cloud
  - If the wind start coming back at your faces, it may be decrease in intensity
  - Either way, check your surroundings
  - Constantly in a state of change
  - Good idea to see if you can see dust rising into wall cloud. If so, youre likely too close
  - shapes
    - small, big, organized, unorganized
    - Isolated lowering from main base of the updraft 
    - Usually sloping toward where rain is occuring
  - When you see something, notice and report the trends

### Tail Cloud
- Scary looking clouds, horizontal cloud
- I.e. inflow cloud
- Often laminar, tube shaped

### Rear Flank Downdraft
- Region of dry air subsiding on the back of, and wrapping around a cyclone
- Important visual precursor to tornadogenesis
- Sinking air dries and warms, erodes cloud
- Can produce winds in excess of 60 mph

### Funnel Cloud
- Tubular shaped column of rotating cloud that does not reach the ground
- Look for:
  - Rotation
  - Persistence & organization
  - Changes & trends
  - No debris
- once more than halfway to the ground, pay attention to whats happening at the ground level
  - Swirls of dust and debris at ground level indicate tornado
- changes in closeness to ground can be very quick
- sometimes rather disorganized looking
- somestimes there can be multiple

### Tornado
- violently rotating column of air in contact with ground and extending from a cumulonimbus cloud
- You can have a violently rotating column of air without a visible funnel
- Electronic devices will destroy night vision


### Gustnado
- Swirling dust
- Typically caused by an outrush of air (outflow/gust front) on leading edge of outflow
- Moves away from the storm
- Not connected to cloud base // not a tornado
- Still dangerous
- Report

### Landspout
- small tornadoes
- attached to high based thunderstorms
- weak, often short lived
- often with LP supercells

### Scud clouds / scary looking clouds
- Shelf clouds
  - Low, horizontal wedge shaped associated with gust front
  - Attached to the base of the parent cloud
- Rain shafts
  - Visible column of rain falling from the base of clouds
- Virga
  

### Radar
- The only live data is what you see out the window
  - Radar is late

### Safety
- Tunnel vision
- Be aware of the "Dome" surrounding you

### Positioning and Viewing
- Updraft and downdraft area
- Where they meet is the main action area
- Squall
  - Face the line through the windshield. Dont let it broadsie you. (dont get flipped)
- Supercell
  - Position yourself perpendicular. eg. SW to NE supercell, be SE

- Avoid the downshaft
- Best distance from the action area is subjective. Generally 1-4 miles. Rarely 1-2
- Always know which way its moving
- Velocity isnt constant
- supercells have a habit of splitting
  - Right mover vs left mover. 
    - Right: tornado likely
    - Left: Large hail
  - If positioned SE of a right mover, quickly move out of the path!
    - You need to go south
- All bets are off with HP supercells
  - typically rainwrapped, no visibility
  - no safe location for spotting
  - stay out of its way
  - Dont even think of going into the rain area
  - you wont see anything until its too late
- Power Flashes
  - Dont always mean tornadoes. Power lines might be touching each other, limbs might be touching transformers
  - Might just be strong winds
  - Report power flashes
    - Check if it illuminates something above
  - Report what you SEE
  - E.x. using wind turbines as a point of reference for change in direction of a moving object
- Tip to do a better job
  - Find out where your spoting location is ahead of time
    - Look for landmarks
    - Determine how far they are from the spotting position
    - This can keep you safe AND increase report accuracy
- A good spotter reports:
  - hail
  - Wind gusts
  - Storm damage
  - Flooding
  - Wall clouds
  - Funnel clouds
  - Tornado
  - Power flashes
    - Are power flashes changing with time

Report:
- When, how long it lasts
- Where the item is, where you are

- Dont assume they already know
- You may be the only person that has a clear view
  
- Hail:
  - We want to know the largest size that fell
- Wind Speed:
  - Specify if wind speed is estimated or measured
  - Spotters tend to overestimate wind speed
  - Measuring outside vehicle is not recommended
  - 25-31 mph: large branches in motion
  - 31-?: whole trees 
- Wind damage:
  - report damage
  - 
- Tornado Report
  - Report only what you see
  - Report YOUR location
  - report the location of the tornado
  - time of the tornado
  
- Flood report
  - How dep is the water
  - Is the road closed
  - Are homes or structures threateened
  - Is road or bridges washed out
  - Is water covering the road
  - Are resuces ocurring
  - Is water moving swiftly
