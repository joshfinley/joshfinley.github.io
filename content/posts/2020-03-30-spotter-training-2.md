Notes on Advanced Severe Weather Spotter Training webinar #skywarn.

## On the Agenda

1. Reporting refresher
2. Severe weather meteorology
3. Storm structure and evolution (deep dive)

At the NWS office:
- They know theres a storm
- They think theres severe weather
- They need groundobservations to verify

- They need a prepoderance of evidence
  - Mainly radar data and spotter reports
  - Conceptual models
  - Storm history
  - Forecaster intuition
  - Forecaster experience
  - Potential storm impacts
  - Potential warning impacts

Deciding on a type of warning:
- spotters are very important for this component

NWS Warnings
- Paradigm:
  - Severe Thunderstorm worning
    - elevated wording
    - tornado possible
    tornado
    - radar
    - observed
    - considerable
    - catastrophic
    - Spotter reports drive the message



## Reporting refresher

### What makes a good report?
- Timely
- Concise
- Calm
- Clear
- Accurate
- Objective

### Components
- who are you
  - name
  - im a trained spotter in NWS norman
  - if with spotter group
- where are you
- what do you see
- where did you see it
- when did it happen

### Where to report
- 405-325-3816
- spotternetwork.org
- amateur radio: WX5OUN
- twitter: @NWSNorman/@NWSTulsa
- mPING: mping.nssl.noaa.gov
- after the fact: sr-oun.spotter@noaa.gov
  
### If reporting a tornado
- distinguish between tornado, funnel cloud, wall cloud
- are you sure its a tornado?
- if you can see ground or cloud base under it, consider funnel cloud or wall cloud
- is it connected to the cloud base
- is it in contact with ground
- is it in the part of the storm where tornadoes develop
  - distinct from gustnados and landspouts
- is it rotating
  - or just a big downdraft
- can you see any debris

### Describing a tornado
- report exactly what you see
- choose words wisely

### Severe Thunderstorm Definition
- 1"+ hail & 58mph wind and tornado
- wind damage and hail damage very useful in reports

### Wind Damage
- underrated, but important to report
- related to outbuildings, trees, powerlines, etc.

### Reporting Damage
- Location
- Time it happened (if known)
- Description/images/video
- If not sure what caused it, dont assume it was a tornado

### Power Flashes
- Arc from shorted out powerline
- Wind causing lines to touch
- Object resting across live wires
- Report power flashes
- Dont assume that a power flash means a tornado
- Can help confirm tornado if other clues are present


### In General
- pictures are very useful
- www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/spcousom is the next step after this video

## Severe Weather Meteorology
Mostly mesoscale scale features rather than storm scale



Where to monitor data:
- www.spc.noaa.gov
  - Forecast tools page
    - Upper air maps
    - Skew-T charts
    - Mesoanalysis maps with derived severe weather parameters


Ingredients for supercells:
- moisture
- instability
- lift
- windshear

### Moisture
Oklahoma
- main moisture source is Gulf of Mexico
- Measurement: dewpoint around 50-55* for supercells, higher for tornadic supercells
- When air feels real most, basically
- Example. May 9th 2010, dewpoints where low to mid sixties 
  - 90 * fahrenheit air/ 68*F dew

Tornado Likelihood:
- low level moisture
- causes higher instability in low levels
- supports stronger and persistent updrafts

Southern/southeasterly winds across plains transport low level moisture
- difference between dewpoint and low level related to likelihood

Monitoring Moisture
- oklahoma mesonet website has great observations on moisture
- SPC mesonalaysis graph page
- Raw Skew-T plot moisture from surface to top of atmosphere


### Instability
Stable vs unstable:
- balloon example. Cool air at surface, balloon will want to rise less
- cool lower, warm upper layer is stable
- inverse is unstable

The cap
- theres a sliver of warm air that is keeping air parcels from rising any further upward
- inhibits severe thunderstorm development
- AKA convective inhibition (CIN)

Skew-Ts
- Red line is environment temperature
- Temperature on x axis, pressure on Y
- How to read:
  - temperature at 500 millibars, follow y line to the red line at 500 millibars
  - yellow is the temperature of bubble of air as it rises
    - it rises and cools
  - green is dewpoint
  - area between redline  and yellow line
    - greater area is greater convective available energy (CAPE)
  - A cap on a skew t looks like an area on the bottom where parcel temperature is lower than environment temperature at the altitude

Monitoring instability
- greater than 1000 joules per kg is considered unstable
- SPC mesoscale analysis
  - thermodynamic data
    - most often use CAPE and Mixed layer CAPE
  - Lifted index used to determine instability of an airmass
    - comparing temperature at two different levels
  - Lapse rates
    - mostly used for hail potential estimation
    - rate that temperature is changing as you gain altitude
    - closer to 7.5 or greater indicate severe hail threat
  - LCL Height
    - Lower the cloud base the more potential for tornado development
- instability in NWS discussions

# Lift

Multiple kinds. Means "something to give a nudge upward"

May include:
- Fronts (cold & warm)
- Dry lines
  - can be important in our part of the country
  - seperation of humid and dry air
- Outflow boundaries
  - thunderstorms can generate lift themselves
- Sufficient solar heating discrepencies in ares

Frontal Lift:
- lift along a warm front is more gradual than a cold front
  - lighter percipition, percipitation well ahead of a front
- Cold front
  - air rises more abruptly, rain right ahead of the front

Convergance
- Surface heating
  - some land areas heating up more than others
  - locally warm air will rise and surrounding air will move in from the sides to fill its place
  - no where to go but up
  - enough of it, clouds are generated. if sustained, can produce thunderstorms

Dry Lines
- big discrepencies in moisture,
- watch for intersecting air currents pushing those areas together
- storms often form right in front of the dry line, on the moist side

Outflow boundaries
- could outflow pushes away from a storm
- the area between the boundary and the storm has potential for new storms.
- that area is a zone of lift

Monitoring Boundaries
- SPC mesoanalysis page

## Wind Shear
- increase of wind speed or direction with height
- important for forming supercells, without it the storm kills itself by downdrafting on itself
- Deep sehar needed for supercells

Multiple different types
- simple change with windspeed with height
- change in direction with height
- change in wind speed AND direction with height
  - biggest potential for instability

Skew-T charts
- Windws plotted at right
- Wind speed
  - Add the lines
    - long line is ten, short line is 5
    - triangle is 50
- Shear for supercells
  - Do winds change in direction and speed as you move from bottom of sounding to 500 mb level
- Shear for tornados

- Change in wind speed and direction causes vortex tubes
  - An updraft can tilt this vortex tube and caued vertical rotation

- Review
  - Supercell has a persistent rotating updraft (aka mesocyclone)
  - Low level wind shear is the focus for tornado likelihood


Likelihood scenario
- high low level windshear in the lowest levels (esp. lowest 1 km)
- surface winds become more easterly (backing of winds)
- Increases along boundaries such as outflow
- Tornadogenesis more likely if a supercell travels parallel along the boundary
- Sometimes storm-scale environment may compensate for a lack of larger scale environmental conditions


In this part of the country, the low level jet enhances low level shear/helicity

Monitoring Wind Shear:
- spc page has wind shear tab:
  - Effective bulk shear - deep layer wind shear
    - greater than 30/35 knots is good enough for supercell dev
  - Low level windshear
    - surface to 1 km
      - higher values suggest better potential
      - greater than 20 knots is ideal for tornadogenesis

## Storm Structure and Evolution

Build upon the mesoscale features

Anatomy of a supercell: side view

- Storms start with an updraft
  - strong updrafts more likely to produce severe weather
  - can be above 100 mph
  - what goes up must come down. Air cools and causes rain/downdrafts
  - Rotation is what makes the supercell persistent

Types of supercells
- low precipitaiton supercell
  - less dangerous
- Classic supercell
  - medium dangerous
- High precipitation supercell
  - most dangeorus, mostly because of visibility

Side view vs top view:
LP supercell:
- weaker reflectivity
- smaller flanking line
Classic supercell
- more defined flanking line, greater reflectivity

HP supercell
- Large, high reflectivity hook

Types of downdrafts
- Forward Flank Downdraft (FFD)
  - Usually to the east or northeast of supercell
  - Do not want to be near - low visibility an
- Rear Flank Downdraft
  - very strong winds
  - can be more damaging than the tornado itself
  - can possibly by clear slots 
  - can be wet dry or both
  - warm is buoyant and unstable
  - RFDs can be wet or dry (precip)
  - Warmer RFDs are more unstable

Mesocyclone
- defining feature of a supercell
- rotating thunderstorm updraft

MS formation
- ambient shear creates a horizontal vortex tube
- updraft tilts the vortex up and streches it, incresing windspeed

Tornadoes
- an intense rotating column of air
- that is in contact with the ground
- that extends from a thunderstorm cloud

### Tornadogenesis stages

development:
- can develop from ground upward or the middle or low levels downward
- RFD and precipitatio southwest  may signal higher likelihood
  

mature:
- strongest, most dangerous
- near vertical orientation, may not extend to ground or is hidden
- if there is debris on the ground, there is a tornado

dissipating
- RFD wraps around the tornado
- RFD cuts off inflow
- tilts/becomes more ropelike or snakey

Cyclic supercells
- inflow can be refocused and cause a new tornado to form
  
Current Theory on Supercell tornadogenesis
- a nontornadic supercell something tornado genesis - https://sites.psu.edu/pmarkowski/

### QLCS

- Quasi Linear Convective System
  - squall lines and bow echoes
- Can be very dangerous
- Supercells have mesocylones, QLCS have mesovortices
- Can be just as strong but are very different
- Dont expect updraft striations
- Often rainwrapper
- Not all mesovortices produce tornadoes
- 90% of these mesovortices ef1 or less
- can still be very dangerous
- May 25th 2019 El Reno tornado
  - Short lives, brutal tornado
- Much more dangerous to stormspot
  - quick moving
  - rain wrapped
  - short lived

Scales of vortices
- Extratropical cyclones
- Mesoscale convective vortices
- mesocyclones
- tornadoes
- suction vortices
- hurricanes
- mesolows
- mesovortices
- gustnados
- landspouts
- dustdevils

#### Landsputs
- higher base

#### Gustnado
- along outflow of thunderstorm
- detached form cumulonimbus clouds
- any sort of wind shear can cause rotation
- can have damaging wind gusts

### Safe Positioning
- Storm motion
- Road network
- Position of vehicle

- Be aware of splitting supercells
  - Left split - more likely hail
  - Right split - more likely tornadoes
    - can even turn south/southest

Most important point
- Dont get killed
