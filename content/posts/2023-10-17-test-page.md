# Test Page for Site Customizations

This is a test page designed to showcase various site customizations, including shortcodes, features, and styling elements. It serves as a development and display platform for these enhancements.

## Introduction

Welcome to our test page! Here, we'll demonstrate the use of footnotes, citations, headers, and other custom elements that have been implemented on this site. This page is crucial for ensuring that all our customizations work correctly and look as intended.

## Footnote and Citation Demonstration

Let's start by using some footnotes and citations. Did you know that the first website was published in 1991?{{< footnote >}}The first website was created by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN and went live on August 6, 1991.{{< /footnote >}} This fact is also discussed in detail by Berners-Lee himself{{< citation content="Berners-Lee, T., & Fischetti, M. (1999). Weaving the Web: The original design and ultimate destiny of the World Wide Web by its inventor. Harper San Francisco." />}}.

Here's another interesting fact: the average person blinks about 15-20 times per minute{{< citation url="https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.870120629" />}}.{{< footnote >}}Blinking serves to keep the eye moist and to protect it from potentially damaging stimuli, such as bright lights and foreign bodies.{{< /footnote >}}

## Header Levels Demonstration

### This is an H3 Header

We're using various header levels to structure our content. This helps in organizing information and improves readability.

#### H4 Header Example

Even smaller headers can be useful for subsections.

##### H5 Header

And we can go even smaller if needed.

## Shortcode and Feature Testing

This section is dedicated to testing other shortcodes and features that might be implemented on the site. For example, we could test a custom image shortcode here.{{< footnote >}}Shortcodes in Hugo are special tags that can be used in your content files to add custom functionality or styling.{{< /footnote >}} Hugo provides extensive documentation on how to create and use shortcodes{{< citation title="Hugo Shortcodes Documentation" />}}.

You can also use the citation shortcode with inner content like this:
{{< citation >}}
Hugo Documentation. (n.d.). Shortcodes. Retrieved August 22, 2023, from https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/
{{< /citation >}}

## Figure Shortcode

Our figure shortcode now uses the caption as alt text when no specific alt text is provided. Here are some examples:

### Centered Figure

{{< figure 
  src="/test-img-1.jpg" 
  caption="This figure is centered in the article body" 
  position="center" 
  width="80%" 
>}}

### Full-Width Figure

{{< figure 
  src="/test-img-1.jpg" 
  caption="This figure spans the full width of the page" 
  position="full" 
>}}

### Inline Figure with Text Wrap

Here's an example of an inline figure with text wrapping around it. {{< figure 
  src="/test-img-1.jpg" 
  caption="This is an inline figure" 
  position="right" 
  width="30%" 
>}} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam euismod, nisl eget aliquam ultricies, nunc nisl aliquet nunc, vitae aliquam nisl nunc vitae nisl.

### Figure with Custom Alt Text

{{< figure 
  src="/test-img-1.jpg" 
  caption="This figure has a custom alt text" 
  alt="A detailed description of the image for screen readers"
  position="center" 
  width="50%" 
  class="custom-figure" 
  id="special-figure" 
>}}

## Blockquotes

{{< blockquote source="Author Name, Book Title" >}}
This is the quoted text.
{{< /blockquote >}}

## Conclusion

This test page has demonstrated the use of:

1. Multiple header levels
2. Footnotes
3. Flexible citations and bibliography
4. Structured content

By maintaining and updating this page, we can ensure that our site's custom features are working correctly and looking great. Remember, the footnotes and bibliography should appear at the bottom of this page!{{< footnote >}}If you're seeing this footnote at the bottom of the page, along with a properly formatted bibliography, congratulations! The footnote and citation systems are working correctly.{{< /footnote >}}
