> This post outlines a plan for a full year of cardio, strength, and athletic training, aimed at taking an out-of-shape powerlifter and transforming them slowly into a well rounded athlete. Cardio, strength, and athletic cababilities are gradually built in a way that emphasizes long-term sustainability. The plan follows a 3-4 day per week system with a phasic structure.

## Introduction


## Problems & Goals

### Problems in Contemporary Fitness Programming

**Inflated strength base from powerlifting focus**

High specialization for the three powerlifting movements will build a strength *base* that is overall artificial. The reason is that this type of training prioritizies short and near term improvments in neuromuscular conditioning to move heavier weight, rather than strength during longer bouts.

With an artificial / inflated strength base, high volume and intensity in repetition ranges that might look manageable on paper may cause an overexposure to training stress.

Powerlifting training modalities will often feature training phases with higher volume, but the exercise choices and repetition ranges will still be biased towards the powerlifting movements. Overall, an athlete with respectable powerlifting numbers can still be brittle overall. 

**Absent cardiovascular base / energy systems only trained for explosive effort**

The high specialization for powerlifting also leads to an overall decline in general physical preparedness, especially cardiovascular fitness. While very short and intense bouts (usually less than 30 seconds) are experienced regularly in weight training, other cardiovascular zones are and energy systems are left untrained.

Most off-the-shelf programs will not address cardiovascular training, and users are left to find other training plans for cardio training or improvise. This will often result in cardio and strength training being pursued out of sync with one another. Compounding the issue, while there has been an explosion of information for strength training, there appears to be far less useful resources for cardio training.

Many cardio training plans do not foremost emphasize building good *training habits*. A lifter may be used to going into the gym several times a week consistently for years, but adding in cardio can represent a significant change in their lifestyle. Building it into a habit before even thinking of pushing thresholds in duration or intensity will improve compliance greatly, especially over the long term.

In order to address these issues, we need to build training plans with several key goals in mind. Each goal has several methods that can be used to reach it.

### Training Plan Design Goals

**Design Goal: Conduciveness to long-term adaptations**

Training programs meant to make serious changes need to take compliance equally seriously. While a 12 week program is relatively easy to complete, there is a reason that longer programs are rarely published -- they will rarely be completed. 

This means that it is extremely important to introduce lifestle changes gradually. In this context, any change to the daily or weekly routine of the user constitutes a lifestyle change. The following types of changes meet this definition:

- Addition or removal of training days

Lifestyle changes should also be introduced and sustained before scaling. For example, it is better in the long term to provide a gentle introductory period of at least two weeks for any significant change. Adding and removing sessions to a persons schedule is most significant, but changes in the magnitude of stress of any one session is also something that must be considered.

**Design Goal: Comprehensiveness in Training Eergy Systems**

It is not only possible and reasonable to train all three energy systems, but doing so is important for overall health, preparedness, and athletic capability.

To achieve this, it is necessary to expose the trainee to exercises in each energy system; each energy system can also be expressed differently based on *which* exercise is being used and *how* that exercised is being performed. For example, bodyweight squats can be done for many more repitions over the course of a training session than a barbell squat, although they are the same movement pattern. Jusy by adding or removing load, we can scale the exercise to different energy systems.

**Design Goal: Comprehensiveness in Movement Patterns**

While it is neither possible nor necessary to train every movement pattern equally, training should cover a comprehensive range of movement patterns, from locomotion, to pushing and pulling, to rotation and anti-rotation.

Variety in exercise selection can ensure that a wide range of movement patterns are covered during training. This variety has the added benefits of reducing risk of overuse, mitigating nervous system fatigue, and preventing feelings of monotony.

The choice of exercise also lets us explore different exercises through a different energy system. An example of this is the common Rikishi training session prelude of high repetition, long duration bodyweight exercises like *the Shiko*. A sumo round may only be a few momemnts long, but the long duration, high repetition training develops skill and flexibility in a way that an actual match can't mimic.
